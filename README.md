# Reason for building the project

- Practice more with APIs, charts, and statemanagement to create a template site for general administrative tools.

# What I would done differently given more time

- Use Svelte.kit for improved legibility, maintenance, and speed
- Typescript if given more time which may be converted to later on
- Dynamic data sources instead of mock data for some graphs
- Integrate cypress for testing
